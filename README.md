# Kata: Next bigger number with the same digits

## Summary

This kata is from [coderwars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/next-bigger-number-with-the-same-digits/javascript).

You have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns the next bigger number formed by the same digits:

```js
nextBigger(12)==21
nextBigger(513)==531
nextBigger(2017)==2071
```

If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:

```js
nextBigger(9)==-1
nextBigger(111)==-1
nextBigger(531)==-1
```

## Thought & Solution

First let's see how to compare 2 numbers.
